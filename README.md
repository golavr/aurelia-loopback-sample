To run the client you need to have Aurelia CLI. From the command line, use npm to install the CLI globally

Once you have the CLI installed. Execute the following command from within the client folder
```sh
au run

If you would like to have it auto-refresh whenever you make changes to your HTML, JavaScript or CSS,
simply use the --watch flag
```sh
au run --watch
```
See [the CLI documentation](https://github.com/aurelia/cli) for other available commands or type `au help` on the command line.
